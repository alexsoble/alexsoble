Call To Action For Chicagoans
================================

On the Friday night after the election, I sat in a circle talking with my fellow Chicagoans. One woman said that she saw a bright spot: Illinois was the first state to be called for Hillary Clinton on election night. She was proud of that.

The electoral college map is a good way to figure out who our next President will be. It is not a good lens for looking at our country. The map sorts states into Red and Blue. If you emotionally identify with Blue, and your state is Blue, it suggests that your state is alright.

I wished that I could share that woman's pride in our state's politics. Our state and our city are not alright. I love Chicago. But I hate its politics. The state of our state is very ugly.

Chicago suffers from hypersegregation.

Chicago suffers from divestment in Black and Brown communities.

Chicago suffers from police impunity.

Illinois suffers from dysfunctional government.

Illinois suffers from a corrupt Democratic establishment.

Illinois suffers from an unjust and inequitabale distribution of taxation.

All of these things were true the day before the Presidential election, and all of them were true the day after. These issues demanded our urgent attention and action the day before the presidential election. And they demand them now. We have so much work to do.

Nearly four-fifths of Chicagoans wanted to see a Democrat in the White House. I wonder how many of them are satisifed with the Democratic leadership in their own state. I wonder how many of them are satisifed with the Democratic leadership in their own city.

Four years from now, when I watch the Red and Blue states on television, here are the questions I pledge to ask myself:

+ How hard have I worked to build a more equitable Illinois: one where schools on the South Side of Chicago have equal funding to schools on the North Shore?

+ How hard have I worked to clean up corruption in our state and city: removing the Madigan machine from power, and passing public campaigin financing in Chicago?

+ How hard have I fought to fund funded restorative justice programs, mental health clinics, jobs programs, and others to help build a more equitable city?

This work can take many forms: Pressuring legislators. Showing up to rallies. Donating to causes. Building websites. Organizing your friends or family or religious community.
