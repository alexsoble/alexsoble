JMO and Alex Chat about Hack Night
================================

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> Hello!

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> Hi! You ready?? Hang on, let me put something away.

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> Sure thing!

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> okay! Coffee? Check. All my other stuff put away? Check. Let’s do this.

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> OK great! Let's chat. I hear you have 5 Rules for Hack Nights?!? Tell me about them.

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> Yes!

Okay. 1) Start with a question.

And you will need to invite people from the community in to co-discover those questions.

So, don’t start with the data you have. Start with the question someone wants to answer. Like,

SchoolCuts started with questions such as “Which schools are likely to be targeted for closing?” and “What is considered to be a better performing school anyway?"

Hack Nights are great opportunities to sit people around a table and talk to them about their questions, everyday problems and frustrations.

2) Don’t code without insight into the problem you are trying to solve.

In other words, asking a question may not be enough. You may have to work with others or do some investigation yourself into the context that the question sits in…Whether that is secondary research done in a Hack Night Setting, or getting out of the room between Hack Nights into the “field”.

An example would be related to the question, “How can we get people in all neighborhoods to healthier grocery stores?"

If we just ended there, maybe we could build an app re: routes in neighborhoods to grocery stores, times the store is open, etc. But when we get into a neighborhood that is in the middle of a grocery desert, we realize that the question changes. The insight is that there aren’t close by grocery stores. That the stores people do go to may not have fresh produce. Oh, look, there is a farmer’s market. Or here someone has started a project with a fresh foods truck that comes around. Maybe the better “hacked” solution is a locator for the food truck so you know when/where it will be. It becomes less about where grocery stores are located. And more about shortening the distance between people and healthy food.

3) Vet the projects for “Hack for Change” events carefully. Make sure that they already have the question they are trying to answer, the insight AND the location of the data nailed down. Make it about the tech solution and coding. OR acknowledge that…without those 3 things, a team’s success might not be an app. It might be the finding of one of those 3 things.

It might be as important to celebrate developing a way to connect the insight to the data needed to answer it as it is to code anything.

4) Do as much as you can to welcome non-coders into a Hack Night space as you possibly can. Even if they don’t “get” tech or code. Especially if they don’t look, talk, or think like you do. Non-tech people can be intimidated by how the tech folks present themselves, their space, their language.

Make the event about them. An orientation for non-coders as well as coders.

5) Find your translators and use them. The community activist world and the tech world don’t naturally speak the same language. Designers and coders don’t always prioritize the same things. Find those people in the community who can bridge groups, and set them up as intermediaries at events, for projects, etc. Make them official so they have a place, and others know they can help to “interpret” if needed.

Those are my 5. Do you have any?

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> Hmmmm . . . not that I've thought about and put into list form! I want to talk about yours because I think they are WONDERFUL.

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> I love Chi Hack Night and I wish I could go every Tues.

I credit them fully for kicking my work on school data up at least 10 levels.

Derek, Juan, and Christopher were my connectors.

Josh was a translator for me.

So, part of my white professional privilege meant that I was set up to feel comfortable there.

It was a space that I was familiar with, and not intimidated by. That said, I received a lot of positive encouragement and interest from the attendees at Hack Night from my first visit.

And that made it VERY easy to interact with people.

If I was, for example, a public school teacher—a middle aged woman of color who was not used to corp tech spaces—I don’t know how easy or comfortable it would have been to navigate that space.

That is where intermediaries can really come in handy

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> What steps could the hack night take to become a more inclusive place?

How can we recruit more intermediaries and support them?

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> Great question.

I’ll tackle the first one to start.

Hold Hack Night events in different spaces around the city every once in awhile. This is going to be more work, more logistically challenging.

But making the collaboration opportunity closer to the community with the information you need, that would be huge.

A church in Pilsen. U of C Campus. A coffeeshop in Englewood. Not easy.

There is Wifi access, and outlets, and transportation, etc. But! I think the Hack Night community would strengthen their community data network.

I don’t know how I would label this, but I see the types of data that the Hack Night community working with in “buckets"

There is the data provided through Open Data…cityofchicago.gov. etc.

There is the data that has not been “opened” all of the way yet but still exists somewhere in quantitative formats…some of the CPS data used to be under this umbrella. It wasn’t on cityofchicago.org but it was out there in PDFs

Someone had it.

And then there is the qualitative data in communities…how things work, how people make decisions, etc.

The qualitative data…the process maps, the decision-making trees that are implicit…those can really help hackers to make sense of and design around the quantitative or “spreadsheet” data.

That is the data you can really only get in 3 ways: 1) going into the field/community and looking/listening for it. 2) being a member of the community with an experience so universal to all demographics that you can represent the community, 3) Bringing in members of the community who are self-aware and proficient in explaining how things work to you (harder to find than people think)

Hack nights historically and serendipitously rely on 3

If someone wanders into the Hack Night who has the capacity for 3, great! But it is often a happy accident, versus an intentional analysis of various community networks and an intentional strategy of getting those people in.

Sometimes they come along as part of someone talking in front of Hack Night, but even those folks often have more knowledge as onlookers, versus participants.

Not always. But a lot of the time.

The most interesting Hack Night to me, personally, would be to invite in a group of, say, school principals. Or public health nurses and patients (together).

They aren’t there as tech people, or even data people. They are there as experts in their community.

The key is though…having the space and opportunity to do it.

That is why I don’t think Hack Night is dead.

Kill Hack Night and we lose an awesome opportunity.

One of the cooler things about Chi Hack Night is that, although it is still majority white and male (that’s a lot of tech), it is also women and minorities. So you are seeing people who look like/sound like you which signals, “You are included also."

I don’t know if that is typical nationally. Or specific to Chicago.

But people like Lincoln Chandler, Demond Drummer, Anna Marie Tamayo…it’s see different people behind those laptops than the stereotype.

I would be interested in hearing from those folks and others about what it would take to make Hack Night more diverse and inclusive. I personally know black women who code, but I’m not seeing them at Hack Nights. And I don’t know why that is (and it could have changed, I haven’t been able to attend for awhile)

Second question: How can we recruit more intermediaries and support them? But I’m going to take a breath first and see if you want to get a word in edgewise here :slightly_smiling_face:

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> I think both of your suggestions are right on point!

I agree that having hack night in River North every week is a barrier to building a more inclusive community

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> Just going to Merchandise Mart is intimidating… It’s not intimidating for me…I used to work in corporations. But it’s intimidating for many.

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> Building an actively welcoming culture takes work.

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> So much work

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> It takes setting and fostering norms about how you treat new people.

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> YES!

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> You are so right that the place we meet sends signals and sets cues that are easy to miss if you're comfortable in downtown office settings. You mentioned that changing up where we meet would mean more logistical work.

I think if we empowered hack night members to set up alternative spaces for the hack night, the vision you described of Pilsen churches and U of C Campus and a coffeeshop in Englewood could really happen.

The hack night community has members who live or work in all of those neighborhoods.

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> I think it is possible, absolutely.

3 nights in River North, 1 night out in community. Or 2 and 2

The geo location is 1/2 of the challenge

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> Let's talk about the other half

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> That’s where the intermediaries come in.

You need those community-based people who understand the world of data/tech (Demond Drummer is a perfect example) and also understand activism and the neighborhood.

Otherwise you have a group on one side with their laptops, frustrated that the conversation about community problems doesn’t quickly get to the main points of “problem” and “data”.

And a group no the other side who has a lot of knowledge but may not know “how” to package that knowledge for the data/tech people.

When I came to my first Hack Night, I was absorbed in pretty quickly because I came with everything already packaged in a way that they could understand it.

I had my spreadsheets. Had my variables mapped. Had my problems analyzed.

This would have looked a LOT different if I had been a frustrated CPS parent who just showed up with no laptop, no data.

No pre-existing knowledge of what was possible in an online interface. I had all that. I used to work in UI/UX

And I’m an ethnographer.

It’s a mindset that is well primed to work in the space with tech folks/coders

I just happened to also be someone who was embedded.

So. We need to find folks who are embedded. And those who are used to working with the “embedded”. Ethnographers and org consultants are just as interested in civic and social change. They just don’t have a specific role to play in the Hack Night space unless they also show up with data and/or coding skills

I used to BEG my grad students in the Learning & Org Change program to visit Hack Night

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> Did any of them go? What was their experience like?

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> None of them did! They didn’t believe me that they didn’t have to code or bring data.

That they could just…go.

I think Liz Gerber eventually sent some of her design researchers down there to observe Hack Night as a research project. But not as participants.

I think some of the Knight Lab students have been by…I’m not entirely sure.

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> We get a lot of computer science students for sure

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> CS, yes. Those are the folks who assume it is their space.

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> Exactly

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> But the folks who can do an organizational analysis, who understand decision-making systems analysis, or who are just really good at listening/observing and mapping community problems…those are the folks w/o an explicit tribe there.

Juan used to kind of take those folks under his wing

Before he left

He was probably the closest person to a connector for that group

I think…maybe that is part of it. The roles that are needed to get a really robust project off of the ground are not explicit, not on the wall. I can’t walk into the room and, on Night #1, point to a diagram on the wall and say, “What do I do? I do THAT."

So that everyone at the table knows, “OH! Okay, JMO is the person who is going to be asking questions about how people make decisions."

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> Absolutely. I think there is a major assumption that groups are self-organizing.

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> Well, they are self-organizing around writing code :slightly_smiling_face:

But these projects are only as good as the analysis and insight that informs the code

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> What can we do to encourage and support and retain the connectors and the interpreters?

For example

When I think about that category

I think about you, Juan, Demond

Being at a volunteer event on a weeknight, every single week, is extremely difficult

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> Such a good question. Hmm. I haven’t been there since…2014?

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> Yes but when I think about what makes hack night important I think of YOU! And SchoolCuts!
<span class="username">jmochicago</span> Hahaha. So, your point is proven by the fact that I haven’t been able to be there since 2014

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> At least for me, that was a very inspiring and eye-opening project

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> there was so much about that project that was unusual.

But yes, it was a fun project

 (Not the subject matter, the team)

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> I saw parent leaders and CPS employees working together a time when the news and the politics were all about strife and disagreement. That kind of collaboration struck me as totally essential

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> The thing that made it work was…we were trying to understand a very specific event

And we had clear, concise questions about what we didn’t know. And those clear questions automatically drew people to us.

The data did not pull in people, or the coding. It was the questions.

“What does ‘mobility’?” indicate?

How are schools being ranked and where does that info come from?

Those questions created an energy.

“How do we explain to parents what the possible scenarios are if their school is closed?"

The questions were the invitation for others to get involved.

Blogging about the project really helped with that.

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> I love the way you describe this

And I think these things are true of so many of the best hack night projects

"very robust, but very sensitive to navigate."

"we were trying to understand a very specific event"

"The questions were the invitation for others to get involved."

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> Right

We have those people in organizations when there is work to be done on multi-disciplinary teams

The best ones, anyway.

In orgs, you can be on a team without an “interpreter” and it is a painful experience.

In volunteering situations, the team just falls away

I don’t think you will ever get a connector/translator to commit to every single Hack Night

But you might get one to commit to every night a certain project is being worked on (SchoolCuts for me.)

And they will be situated by topic, anyway. Most of the translators/interpreters will be situated in a community, demographic, topic area

(Public health, education from parent persp/admin persp, access to social services, etc.)

So, maybe turning the model of Hack Night inside out is what is needed. Going to community organizations like LISC or RAGE as a volunteer team

Versus community members coming to Hack Night

Does Hack Night have a map of all of the small organizations that are situated in communities and working there?

Like Refugee and Relief services? or Community Clinics in Chicago?

<span class="username">alexsoble</span> I think that is an extremely good idea

<span class="username">jmochicago</span> Hack Night is still creating the opportunity, the conversation…it doesn’t have to be about the space (or the same space)

Anything you can do to get people next to a problem, that’s a good thing. But it is also not the only thing. You also need that opportunity to take the time to observe, reflect, analyze, etc.

That’s “Hack Night"

It’s an opportunity. Not just a night. Or a space.
