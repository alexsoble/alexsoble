  <h1>Hi.</h1>
  <p>I'm Alex. I like reading old books, learning new languages, and exploring Chicago. I build web apps and love technology that contributes to the public good.
  <br/><br/>
  These are a few projects I've built.</p>

  <h2>RailsGirls Chile</h2>
  <p>With co-organizers from Start-Up Chile, En1Mes, and Groupon, I helped put together the first RailsGirls coding weekend in Chile. Two days, 50 participants, 12 coaches, 6 lightning talks, and a whole lot of beers added up to one excellent weekend of learning and fun.</p>

  <h2>Divvy Braggin'</h2>
  <p>I'm a huge bikeshare fan, so shortly after Chicago launched its Divvy bikeshare system, I created an app to let members track their mileage. DNAinfoChicago covered the way the app was <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130926/south-loop/divvy-shuts-down-inventors-mileage-tracking-app">blocked by Divvy's parent company</a> and then <a href="#">brought back</a>.</p>

  <h2>Chicago's Local School Councils</h2>
  <p>Two tweets from the community sparked a new web app for the Chicago Public Schools system, which went on to win "Best Use of Twitter" from Crain's Chicago Business. <a id="crains" href="assets/images/crainsbig.jpg">Read the article in Crain's</a> and the <a href="http://storify.com/alexsoble/cps-builds-an-app-with-help-from-our-friends-on-tw">Storify</a>.</p>
