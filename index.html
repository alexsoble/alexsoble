        <h2>Language Learning + YouTube</h2>
        <p>Language learning is the most fun when it's set to music. That's the idea behind Heyu, a web app I'm building with language teachers and students. Heyu lets anyone turn any YouTube video into a language study resource. <a href="https://www.heyuvideo.com">Check it out at heyuvideo.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>Divvy Braggin'</h2>
        <p>I'm a huge bikeshare fan. Shortly after Chicago launched its Divvy bikeshare system, I created an app to let members track their milage. The app was blocked by Divvy's parent company but started a conversation about creating a legitimate API for Chicago bikeshare data. <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130926/south-loop/divvy-shuts-down-inventors-mileage-tracking-app">Read the DNAinfoChicago story about DivvyBrags</a>.</p>

        <h2>Chicago's Local School Councils</h2>
        <p>Two tweets from the community sparked a new web app for the Chicago Public Schools system, which went on to win "Best Use of Twitter" from Crain's Chicago Business. <a id="crains" href="assets/images/crainsbig.jpg">Read the piece in Crain's</a> and the <a href="http://storify.com/alexsoble/cps-builds-an-app-with-help-from-our-friends-on-tw">Storify</a>.</p>
